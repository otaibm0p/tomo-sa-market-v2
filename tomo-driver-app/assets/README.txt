Add app icons here so Expo can load them:

- icon.png (1024x1024 recommended)
- splash-icon.png (splash screen)
- adaptive-icon.png (Android adaptive icon foreground)

You can use any PNG or generate from your design. Without these, the app may fail to start; you can temporarily point app.json to a single placeholder PNG for all three.
